    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Instant Pot chicken chili is one of the easiest meals to make and is the perfect warming meal for a cold night.  And it freezes well if you need a meal to bring to someone. Or if you just like having meals in the freezer for later.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds chicken breast (3-4)</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>14 ounce (398mL) can brown beans in tomato sauce (also called baked beans)</ul>
        <li>14 ounce (398mL) can black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>14 ounce (398mL) can diced tomatoes (with liquid)</li>
        <li>4 ounce (127mL) can chopped green chilis</li>
        <li>1 cup corn kernels</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken, chicken broth, brown beans, black beans, diced tomatoes, green chilis, corn, salt, pepper, onion powder, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and oregano in the pot of the Instant Pot and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Put the lid on the Instant Pot and lock it into position. Make sure the vent is in the sealing position.</li>
        <li>Set the Instant Pot to manual high pressure for 18 minutes (or the chili setting which will automatically be 18 minutes at high pressure).</li>
        <li>When the cook time is finished, let it naturally release for 10 minutes and then quick release any remaining pressure.</li>
        <li>Shred the chicken with two forks - either in the Instant Pot, or remove it to a cutting board to shred and then return it to the pot.</li>
        <li>Combine the cream cheese and the milk in a small bowl, whisking until smooth. This is easier if you warm up the milk and the cream cheese in the microwave a bit first.</li>
        <li>Stir this mixture into the Instant Pot and press the saute button, adjusting it to low.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes, or until the chili thickens a bit.</li>
        <li>Serve with any toppings you like.</li>
        <li>Leftover chili keeps in the fridge for 3-5 days, or freeze it for up to 6 months.</li>
    </ol>
